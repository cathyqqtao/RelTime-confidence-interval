Description of the empirical datasets
=====================================

The archive consists of results of six empirical datasets used in Tao et al. (2019). Each data subfolder contains the Bayesian timetree published in the original study (see Table 1 in Tao et al. 2019) and RelTime results.

 ./RelTime contains RelTime settings and results. Files are named as follows:
	
	<dataset>_MX.txt: RelTime estimates of divergence times and confidence intervals, written in the table format.
	<dataset>_MX_nexus.tre: RelTime estimates of divergence times and confidence intervals, written in the nexus format.
	run_RelTime: command to run RelTime using MEGA X (command-line version).
